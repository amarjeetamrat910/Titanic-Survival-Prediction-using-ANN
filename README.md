# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-using-ANN
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. The dataset contains information about passengers such as their age, gender, and fare, which are used to train the MLP model to predict whether a passenger survived or not.
